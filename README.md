The TCP server accepts a connection from the client and receives a text-based message. 
The server then converts each character to the next character in the ASCII sequence.
The server sends this converted message back to the client and the client displays the message.

The UDP server connects to a client, adds a funny message, then the server sends the message back to the client for display.
